Soon, the fixed-rate exchanges will also be\r\n                implemented on the web version. To lock the current exchange\r\n                rate, the user needs to click on the lock icon, which will\r\n                result in them getting the exact same amount of crypto as is\r\n                displayed on the screen. The rate is fixed for 15 minutes, which\r\n                should be more than enough to carry out the exchange.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Alternatively, Tradix offers our lowest fee of 0.25% for all\r\n                crypto-to-crypto exchanges made at a floating rate.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <div class=\"block\">\r\n              <h3>No warranties :</h3>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Elaenia is provided “as is” without any representations or\r\n                warranties.
